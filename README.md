fixDeviantArt
=============

Fixes [DeviantArt](https://www/deviantart.com/) embeds on [Discord](https://). Just replace `deviantart.com` with `fixdeviantart.com` in your url.

This is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and runs as a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), which I think is cool.

Here are some other versions:
- Python: [fxdeviantart](https://github.com/robinuniverse/fxdeviantart)
- NodeJS: [fxdeviantart.js](https://github.com/DorukSega/fxdeviantart.js)

Here's a list of some other embed fixers I've seen: https://fx.nerd.horse/
